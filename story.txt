For some, the whole project was supposed to be a celebration of Britain’s departure from the EU. Which means there
is more than a little irony in the fact a main concern of the “festival of Brexit” organisers was the impact of leaving itself.

was in the firing line once again after
the spending watchdog said it is investigating – after a series of rebrandings – Unboxed: Creativity in the UK amid
concern visitor numbers were less than 1% of early targets.
